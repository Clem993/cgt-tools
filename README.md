| Phase 1 | 20% | × manufacturing risk |
| Phase 2 | 35% | × competitive position |
| Phase 3 | 60% | × reimbursement risk |

### Data Sources

## 📝 Calculations Explained

### Expected Value Formula
```
Expected Value = (Upfront × 100%) + 
                (Dev Milestones × Dev Stage PoS) + 
                (Commercial × Overall PoS) + 
                (Royalty NPV × Overall PoS)
```

### Overall PoS Calculation
```
Overall PoS = Development Risk × 
              Therapy Risk × 
              Manufacturing Risk × 
              Competitive Risk × 
              Reimbursement Risk
```
